Device Information

----- Processor -----
/proc/cpuinfo has the information about the processor(s). This file is not a real file but a representation of what the Linux kernel finds in the system. Every file in the /proc file system is a representation of the kernel's information and every time you read it it gives you the last known state.

cat /proc/cpuinfo

If there are multiple CPUs or multiple cores inside the system, there is going to be multiple entries - one for each CPU/core. 

----- Memory -----
/proc/meminfo has the information about the memory.

free command has the current memory usage statistics including the total amount of memory the system has.

----- PCI Devices -----
lspci lists the information about PCI devices.
lspci -k lists more informaton about which kernel drivers are already used to manage PCI devices.

For example, to find out what graphical controller you have (video card), look for the "VGA compatible controller" entry.

----- USB Devices -----
lsusb shows which USB devices are attached to the system.
