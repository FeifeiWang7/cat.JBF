keyings (in-kernel key management and retention facility)

The keyrings facility is primarily a way for drivers to retain or cache security data, authentication keys, encryption keys and other data in the kernel.

Keyring is a special type of key. The payload consists of a set of links to other keys, analogous to a directory holding links to files. The main purpose of a keyring is to prevent other keys from being garbage collected because nothing refers to them. 

A keyring may be considered the root of a tree or subtree in which keyings are the branches and non-keyrings are the leaves. The tree may be searched.
