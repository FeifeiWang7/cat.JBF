keyings (in-kernel key management and retention facility)

The keyrings facility is primarily a way for drivers to retain or cache security data, authentication keys, encryption keys and other data in the kernel.

A key contains the following elements:

- serial number: a unique integer to identify a key in system call

- type

- description: a string that is used to search the key. It can be partially matched or exactly matched

- payload: actual content of a key. It is usually set when a key is created, but it is possible for the kernel to upcall to userspace to get the key if that key is unknown

- assess rights

- expiration time

- reference count: keys are referenced by keyrings, by current active users and by a process's credentials. When the reference count reaches zero, the key is scheduled for garbage collection.
