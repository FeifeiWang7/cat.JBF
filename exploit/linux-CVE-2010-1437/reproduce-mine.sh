#These commands join or create a new keyring and then run a shell or other program with that keyring as the session key.

#The variation with no arguments just creates an anonymous session keyring and attaches that as the session keyring; it then exec's $SHELL.

#The variation with a dash in place of a name creates an anonymous session keyring and attaches that as the session keyring; it then exec's the supplied command, or $SHELL if one isn't supplied.

#The variation with a name supplied creates or joins the named keyring and attaches that as the session keyring; it then exec's the supplied command, or $SHELL if one isn't supplied.
