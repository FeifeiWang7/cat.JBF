# /bin/true is a command that returns 0 (a truth value in the shell). Its purpose is to use in places in a shell script where you would normally use a literal such as "true" in a programming language, but where the shell will only take a command to run.
# /bin/false is the opposite that non-zero (a false value in the shell).

# keyctl session creates or joins the  named  keyring and  attaches  that as the session keyring; it then exec's the supplied command, or $SHELL if one isn't supplied.
